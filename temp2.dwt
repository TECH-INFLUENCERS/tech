<h1>features / photos </h1>
<p>This is the content for Layout P TagDesign The Huawei P40 and Huawei P40 Pro both sport a glass back in ice white, black, deep sea blue, silver frost or blush gold colors, while the Huawei P40 Pro Plus has a ceramic rear in black or white. So colors and material are the big visual difference. Beyond that, the three phones all have a large rectangular camera block in the top left corner, a metal frame and an all-screen design.<br>
</p>
<p> Camera and battery The camera is one of the things that Huawei is pushing most with these phones, and of course it’s most exciting on the Huawei P40 Pro Plus. That phone has a 50MP f/1.9 main sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS), supposedly capable of taking in a lot of light (for great low light shots). It also has a 40MP f/1.8 ultra-wide sensor, an 8MP f/4.4 periscope lens with OIS that’s capable of 10x optical zoom, and an 8MP f/2.4 telephoto lens with OIS, capable of 3x optical zoom. That makes for the world’s first dual-lens optical telephoto system, and combined those lenses allow for 100x digital zoom. Finally, the P40 Pro Plus also has a time-of-flight (ToF) depth sensor, so there are five sensors in all. The other two handsets also have that 50MP main sensor with OIS, but the Huawei P40 Pro pairs it with a 40MP f/1.8 ultra-wide sensor, a 12MP f/3.4 telephoto sensor with 5x optical zoom and OIS, and a ToF sensor.</p>

<p> he sale of the Huawei P40 phone will start on April 7, as the only version was priced with 128 GB storage with 8 GB RAM at a price of 799 euros or 13800 Egyptian pounds.</p>
<p> The new Huawei P40 phone comes with luxury materials as usual in this price category, as it comes with a conventional FHD + screen only from the old type at a normal frequency of 60 Hz, and the hole for selfie cameras is very large, which gives a shape that is not the best for the front end, but Huawei has reduced the edges from the top And the sides are very large and very distinctive. </p>
<p>The processor is a traditional Huawei processor we've seen before in the Mate 30 Pro that offers a very powerful performance with support for fifth generation networks, and the operating system as we know does not come with Google services but Huawei has tried to dispense with Google services by adding applications that you can use to compensate Google applications. </p>
<p>The phone battery is also not the best, we saw a larger battery with faster charging in the middle class such as Nova 7i , the phone also supports a traditional way to open the phone through the face and is a software (using the selfie camera .. without an IR sensor) like all middle phones, and the fingerprint was made At a higher location than on the screen. The strong feature in the phone is the cameras where we saw very strong cameras in the phone that makes it able to compete with other powerful phones that came with distinctive cameras as we saw this period in phones such as Mi 10 and Galaxy S20 . </p>
